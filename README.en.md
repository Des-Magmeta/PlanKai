# Plan Kai / 计划楷 / 計劃楷
An open-source font for Unified Ideographic Extension derived from Fontworks' Klee One.

## Introduction

In December 2020, Japanese type foundry FONTWORKS released [7 Open-source Japanese fonts](https://github.com/fontworks-fonts) on GitHub, with [Klee One](https://github.com/fontworks-fonts/Klee) supporting the most characters. It shares some features with Fangsong and Kaiti, namely elegant composition and high readability. Unlike the textbook-style font, Klee One retains some features of traditional printed fonts.  
In 2021, the font [LXGW WenKai](https://github.com/lxgw/LxgwWenKai) was made by [lxgw](https://github.com/lxgw), which was modified from Klee One, with some characters added. It has become a success. Other font designers also made fonts derived from Klee One, such as [Iansui](https://github.com/ButTaiwan/iansui), [JyunsaiKaai](https://github.com/ItMarki/jyunsaikaai), and so on. With the efforts of font designers, a series of fonts derived from Klee One support many enough characters, especially some characters that aren't supported by Source Han Sans.  
However, there are also a large number of CJK Unified ideographic extensions that can't be displayed directly. These characters either falls back to the Songti, or is displayed as a font that doesn't conform to local standards when they're displayed, and more are displayed as “tofu”.  
Plan Kai is a repository based on Klee One and takes the Chinese Mainland glyphs as the standard to supplement the CJK Unified ideographic extension. This repository was initiated around December 2022. The eventual goal is to complete all the Chinese characters included in Unicode as much as possible, and produce a part of the regular script without the original style of Kaiti(楷体/楷體).
